    <p>Stories, poems, tall tales about the rivers we fish.</p>

        <p>Following rivers throughout the West
        I kept finding stories eddying through my mind,
        the thought of a single trout rising unfolded into poem.
        Sometimes inspired by one-liners from my wiser than time
        fishing buddy Blake, sometimes just watching mayflies
        hatch from the water, these inner narratives took on a life of their own.</p>
        
        <p>If you're thinking, I'm just a trout bum who gets skunked
        most of the time, you'd be right. But out there, when the current
        is running through core, when you're gazing up at the canyon
        carved by the wind over millennia, it's hard not to get lost in stories.</p>
        
        <p>Fly-Fiction is my personal attempt to document that feeling.
        It's casting for that rainbow trout that you know
        is lurking under the alders. It's unclasping your fly box
        to pick out that size 16 elk hair caddis right as
        the sun drops below the rim. Here's my portrait of trout fishing
        my collection of tributaries I carry with me, here's fly-fiction.</p>
