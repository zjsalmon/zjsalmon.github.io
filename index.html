        <p class="intro">Following rivers throughout the West
        I kept finding stories eddying through my mind,
        the thought of a single trout rising unfolded into a poem.
        Sometimes inspired by one-liners from my wiser than time
        fishing buddy Blake, sometimes just watching a mayfly
        hatch over the water, these inner narratives took on a life of their own.</p>
        
        <p>If you're thinking I'm just a trout bum who gets skunked
        most of the time, you'd be right. But out there, when the current
        is running through core, when you're gazing up at the canyon
        carved by the wind and ancient floods over millennia, it's hard not to get lost in stories.</p>
        
        <p>Fly-Fiction is my attempt to document that feeling.
        It's casting for that rainbow trout that you know
        is lurking under the alders. It's unclasping your fly box
        to pick out that size 16 elk hair caddisfly right as
        the sun drops below the rim. Here's my portrait of fly-fishing for trout in the West,
        the collection of tributaries I carry with me, the words that continue to circle.</p>
        
        <p> Welcome to Fly-Fiction.</p>
